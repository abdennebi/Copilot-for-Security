# Copilot for Security Prompt Examples

Prompt engineering is the process of writing, refining and optimizing inputs, or "prompts", to encourage generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems to create specific, high-quality outputs. Prompt engineering helps generative AI models better comprehend and respond to a wide range of queries, from the simple to the highly technical. The basic rule is that good prompts equal good results.

Prompt engineering is a technique that can be used to "program" generative AI models in natural language, without requiring coding experience or deep knowledge of datasets, statistics, and modeling techniques. Prompt engineers play a pivotal role in crafting queries that help generative AI models understand not just the language but also the nuance and intent behind the query. A high-quality, thorough, and knowledgeable prompt, in turn, influences the quality of AI-generated content, whether itâ€™s images, code, data summaries or text.

Prompt engineering is important because it allows AI models to produce more accurate and relevant outputs. By creating precise and comprehensive prompts, AI models are better able to understand the task they are performing and generate responses that are more useful to humans.

Prompt engineering is a skill that can be learned and improved over time, by experimenting with different prompts and observing the results. There are also tools and resources that can help users with prompt engineering, such as prompt libraries, prompt generators, or prompt evaluators.
