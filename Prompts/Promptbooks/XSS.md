Here's a series of prompts that could be used for detecting and mitigating a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack:

1. **Detect Potential XSS Vulnerabilities:**
```
   - Identify any use of `innerHTML`, `document.write`, or `outerHTML` in the codebase.
```
```
   - Scan for any instances where user input is directly included in the DOM without sanitization.
```
```
   - Check for any use of `eval()` or `setTimeout()`/`setInterval()` with user-controlled inputs.
```
2. **Review and Sanitize Inputs:**
```
   - How do I apply input validation to ensure only expected data types and formats are accepted.
```
```
   - How do I implement HTML encoding on all user-supplied input to prevent execution of HTML and JavaScript.
```
```
   - How do I use a library or framework that automatically escapes XSS, such as OWASP's Java Encoder for Java projects.
```
3. **Mitigate Detected XSS Issues:**
```
   - Give me steps to replace direct DOM manipulation with safer alternatives like `textContent` or secure templating systems.
```
```
   - Locate where `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to ensure proper sanitization of the content being set.
```
```
   - Provide an example of a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of executable scripts.
```
4. **Regularly Update and Patch:**
```
   - Ensure all dependencies and libraries are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
```
```
   - How do I regularly review and update the application's CSP to adapt to new threats.
```
5. **Educate and Train Developers:**
```
   - Provide training resources on secure coding practices to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
```
```
   - Give me informaiton on how to conduct regular code reviews with a focus on security and XSS prevention.
```  

These prompts are designed to guide the security analysis process, from detection to mitigation, and ensure a comprehensive approach to securing applications against XSS attacks. Remember, the effectiveness of these prompts depends on the specific context and needs of the project, so they may need to be tailored accordingly.
