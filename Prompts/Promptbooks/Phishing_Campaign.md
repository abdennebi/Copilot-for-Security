To expose a phishing campaign in an environment using Copilot for Security, you could use the following series of prompts:

1. **Identify suspicious patterns**:
   ```
   List recent emails with subject lines containing common phishing trigger words.
   ```

2. **Analyze links**:
   ```
   Analyze the URLs in the latest emails marked as spam for known phishing domains.
   ```

3. **Check sender reputation**:
   ```
   Cross-reference the senders of the last 50 external emails with a database of known phishing attackers.
   ```

4. **Attachment analysis**:
   ```
   Scan attachments from emails flagged as suspicious for malware signatures.
   ```

5. **Behavioral analysis**:
   ```
   Highlight any unusual access patterns in system logs that may indicate a successful phishing attempt.
   ```

These prompts are designed to guide Copilot for Security through a phishing campaign within an environment, from initial identification to detailed reporting. Remember to tailor these prompts to fit the specific context and systems of your organization.
