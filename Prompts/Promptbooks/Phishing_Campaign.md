Prompts that could be used to detect a phishing campaign:

1. **Identify suspicious patterns**: "List recent emails with subject lines containing common phishing trigger words."
2. **Analyze links**: "Analyze the URLs in the latest emails marked as spam for known phishing domains."
3. **Check sender reputation**: "Cross-reference the senders of the last 50 external emails with a database of known phishing attackers."
4. **Attachment analysis**: "Scan attachments from emails flagged as suspicious for malware signatures."
5. **Behavioral analysis**: "Highlight any unusual access patterns in system logs that may indicate a successful phishing attempt."

Remember, these prompts should be tailored to the specific tools and data sources available within your security infrastructure. It's also important to ensure that any actions taken comply with your organization's privacy and security policies.
